Chelsea are set to lose a plethora of key defensive figures from their squad and so far there have been no replacements. The club stated that they have released Andreas Christensen, Danny Drinkwater and Charley Musonda Jr and also lost Antonio Rudiger on a free to Real Madrid, which was possibly the worst kept transfer secret in the past 6 months and are possibly going to lose the Spanish pairing of Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso to Barcelona.With so many significant departures it only makes sense to seek out similar high quality replacements in the backline.

 But Chelsea suffered a huge blow when Didier Deschamps, the France manager, revealed that Joules Kounde would have to undergo knee surgery which would certainly hamper him passing the medical, if Chelsea put in an offer for the highly rated Sevilla defender. Chelsea have been sniffing around Kounde for a while now, and apparently Chelsea had beaten Tottenham and completed the transfer last summer but it unfortunately didn't go through.

Reports have found that the club are also interested in Wolves’ Rayan Ait-Nouri as a backup for Ben Chilwell which would be a very smart choice considering Rayan is still only 21 years old and has massive potential, now that Alonso may be leaving but Thomas Tuchel may consider retaining the sparingly used Emerson Palmieri instead. 

Milan Skriniar is touted to come to Stamford Bridge, but will most definitely command a very hefty price tag which shouldn’t be a problem for the Blues with the backing of new owner Todd Boehly and his consortium. Skriniar was a crucial figure, helping Inter Milan win the Scudetto under Antonio Conte and Chelsea maybe able to leverage the complaining Romelu Lukaku to bring the transfer cost down, but recent rumours suggest that Ruben Loftus Cheek could be going the other way in a straight swap deal.

If Chelsea manage to sign Joules Kounde and the highly rated Milan Skriniar then Thomas Tuchel will have successfully replaced the outgoing duo of Christensen and Rudgier, with similar if not better skilled better players and we should see the Blues take on both Manchester City and Liverpool for title.
